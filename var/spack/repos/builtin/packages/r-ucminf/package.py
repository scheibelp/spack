    """General-Purpose Unconstrained Non-Linear Optimization.

    An algorithm for general-purpose unconstrained non-linear optimization.
    The algorithm is of quasi-Newton type with BFGS updating of the inverse
    Hessian and soft line search with a trust region type monitoring of the
    input to the line search algorithm. The interface of 'ucminf' is designed
    for easy interchange with 'optim'."""
